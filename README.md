# Active OSM

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap) continues to be a valuable tool for people walking, biking, and taking transit. Data related to curb ramps, transit stops, or safe biking routes is often held in disparate data sources, making it challenging to create routing for people looking to walk or roll to meet their daily needs.

This repo is meant to help collate those disparate data sources (see `/opendata`), as well as provide tools to create relevant reports and maps.
